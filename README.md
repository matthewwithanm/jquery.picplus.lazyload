jquery.picplus.lazyload
=======================

Add lazyloading to your [picplus] pictures. Load them when they're scrolled into
your viewport.

If used with [jquery.picplus.queueup], unloaded assets will be promoted as they
enter the viewport (instead of loaded immediately) so you always get the most
important pictures first.
